----------Using MuscleStain class----------

Description:
	The MuscleStain class is used to describe the current state of the processing of a stain

Imports:
	from MuscleStain import *
	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


MuscleStain methods:
	Processing:
		initialize_excel_data(self, filename)
		-Creates the output Excel sheet for this stain
			-self- This object
			-filename- Name of Excel file to output to

		find_fibers(self)
		-Performs Frangi edge mapping and Otsu's method to get binary image of muscle fibers
			-self- This object

		find_fiber_properties(self, rerun_connected)
		-Gets shape descriptor information for blobs found after find_fibers and separate_connected_fibers
			-self- This object
			-rerun_connected- boolean specifying whether this is processing after separate_connected_fibers
				-True if separate_connected_fibers has been run
				-False if separate_connected_fibers has not been run

		classify_blobs(self, classifier)
		-Uses shape descriptors of blobs and given classifier to determine group of each blob
			-self- This object
			-classifier- an sklearn.svm.SVC (support vector machine)

		get_masks(self)
		-Creates masks for blobs classified as Muscle Fibers, Connected Fibers, and Interstitial Space
			-self- This object

		separate_connected_fibers(self, h_test)
		-Performs watershed segmentation on the blobs in the Connected Fiber category
			-self- This object
			-h_test- number used for testing watershed

		refine_contours(self)
		-finds the boundaries of blobs labeled as Muscle Fibers
			-self- This object

	Display:
		overlay_blobs(self, pil_im)
		-Given a PIL image of the stain's fibers_binary, this function overlays it with red numbers corresponding to the blob number
			-self- This object
			-pil_im- a PIL image of this stain's fibers_binary member

		interactive_blobs(self)
		-Allows the user to find the location of blobs by blob number
			-self- This object

		create_classification_image(self)
		-Creates and returns a an image with Muscle Fibers masked in yellow, Connected Fibers in blue, Interstitial Space in purple
			-self- This object

		display_classification(self)
		-Displays the classification image as made from create_classification_image
			-self- This object

		display_contours(self)
		-Displays the stain with Muscle Fiber boundaries outlined
			-self- This object

	Misc:
		block_proc(self, im_gray, block_size, func)
		-Use to break a MuscleStain process that is performed on an image into smaller chunks to use less memory.
			-self- This object
			-im_gray- grayscale image to process
			-block_size- array with 2 values with size of blocks to split image into
			-func- function pointer to run on chunks

		write_data(self)
		-Writes collected data to output Excel file
			-self- This object


Creating a MuscleStain object:
	stain_object = MuscleStain(image)
	--Where:
	-image is an image as read in using matplotlib.pyplot's imread
	-stain_object is the created MuscleStain object
